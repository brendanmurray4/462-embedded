ENSC 462 Lab 1 Report: Brendan Murray
Both Nicholas and I completed this lab together in the lab, both outside of lab hours and during. All of the VHDL was written using pair-programming techniques where one
team member would write code, and the other would be helping brainstorm ideas and spot mistakes. The entire lab was equally contributed to by both team members and we both
worked together on all of the submitted items.
